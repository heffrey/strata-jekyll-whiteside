## About This Project

After years of working in security leadership roles — building governance, risk, and compliance programs — I continue to explore how companies of all sizes can approach security in ways that balance both technical rigor and business realities.

This site serves as a personal space where I share some of my thinking, experiences, and frameworks that I’ve found useful.

## My Approach

Security isn’t about adding endless controls — it's about making smart, risk-aligned decisions that fit your business model.

I focus on:

- Pragmatic advice informed by real-world experience
- Balancing security needs with operational impact
- Building sustainable, adaptable security programs
- Avoiding unnecessary complexity and "security theater"
